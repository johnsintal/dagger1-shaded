## Updating and building

- Change the `dagger.version` property in the parent POM to the desired value. (Current version 1.2.2)
- Run `mvn package` to generate the JARs and use them directly in your project or you can use jar's inside of project
- ...or make the changes in a fork and use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/). And open a PR if it's a new version!# dagger1-shade
